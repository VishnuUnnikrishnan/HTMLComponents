# HTMLComponents
Stores html components that I have built for my projects

1. A better Multiple Select

<img width="515" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f9d746e-2549-473e-8683-918a310e3013" />

  Easy to use, styled by bootstrap components, and easily see whats selected and also remove selected objects easily. 
  
  To get the value its a single line:
  
  class.value

  Compared to:
  
  <img width="490" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57a2c365-72b7-49a4-9b00-cfe57a969de2" />

  In the normal one, you have to ctrl or cmd click to choose multiple and if you make a mistake its harder to unselect. To get the value you need to write 4-5 lines of code minimum.
